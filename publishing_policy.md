# Open Programmable Infrastructure (OPI) Video and Presentation Approval Process

This policy covers the review of technical content for public presentations and Videos about the Open Programmable Infrastructure (OPI) project. The intent is to have a consistent, accurate, and uniform representation of OPI as well as to assist member companies and individuals, not to restrict public discussion about OPI.

---

- Scope
  - This policy covers videos, presentations, or documents with OPI technical content for use in public forums such as industry conferences, academic conferences, or webinars where the presenter is speaking on behalf of OPI or representing an OPI point of view.
  - Company internal presentations or company customer facing presentations that include OPI information or are about OPI are not covered by this policy.
  - To facilitate reuse a set of common slides and content will be approved jointly with the OPI Outreach committee. This will streamline the process of creating and delivering presentions about OPI.
  - Meeting minutes, videos, and recordings for OPI TSC, Subproject, and Working Group do not need approval to post through [lists.opiproject.org](https://lists.opiproject.org/) or [github.com/opiproject](https://github.com/opiproject)

- Technical Content Approval Process
  - Upload the new technical content to the OPI google docs 'under review' presentation area
    - Reuse of already approved content will not require a review.
      - Reuse of approved existing content in OPI public presentations in a different arrangement, sequence, subset, or with a different visual arrangement does not require a new approval.
      - Reformulated or redesigned slides that don't change the content are also allowed. These can be, but are not required to be, submitted to the Outreach Committee for consideration to be included in the pool of common slides.
      - An important use of this policy element is reformatting required to meet a conference's or webinar's mandated template and background or to include an OPI section within a larger presentation covering other topics in addition to OPI.
  - Request for review by the TSC will be via the TSC mailing list or in person during a TSC meeting
  - Approval of new content will be voted on by the TSC at the TSC meeting following the request for review
  - Approved presentations will be posted to the opiproject 'review completed & approved' presentation area
  - Approved videos may be posted to the OPI YouTube Channel
